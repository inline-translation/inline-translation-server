# Inline Translation

ILT is a open-source project to provide an in-app capability to translate/edit localizable strings. 

By providing a this inline-translation capability, costly and time-consuming translation review cycles can be bypassed to accelerate a continuous localization model. 

Via a simple-to-use editor, a linguists is able to either directly translate or edit a given translation in rich context. 
Once a linguists is satisfied with the quality, the translated strings can directly be committed into a central repository
